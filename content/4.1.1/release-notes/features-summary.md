| Authentication                    | MKE 4k uses Dex for authentication, which serves as a proxy between  MKE 4k clusters and authentication providers. Dex supports the following authentication protocols: <br><br>* Basic authentication<br> *  OIDC<br> * SAML<br> * LDAP<br><br>SCIM, which is supported in MKE 3, is not supported in MKE 4k.| [Configure OIDC service for MKE](../../configuration/authentication/oidc/#configure-oidc-service-for-mke), [Configure SAML service for MKE](../../configuration/authentication/saml#configure-saml-service-for-mke), [Configure LDAP service for MKE 4k](../../configuration/authentication/ldap/#configure-ldap-service-for-mke) |
