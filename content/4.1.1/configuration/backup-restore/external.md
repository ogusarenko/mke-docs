title: Back up using an external storage provider
weight: 2
---

You can configure MKE 4k to externally store backups and restores, for example,
in object storage provided by a public cloud provider.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
   AWS S3 is currently the only external backup storage supported by MKE 4k.
{{< /callout >}}

## Configure an external storage provider

{{< callout type="info" >}}

AWS store backups in an object storage bucket. Mirantis recommends that each of
these buckets be unique for each Kubernetes cluster.

{{< /callout >}}

1. Create an S3 bucket:

   ```shell
   aws s3api create-bucket \
       --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> \
       --region <AWS_REGION> \
       --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

   The `us-east-1` region does not support a `LocationConstraint` setting. As such, if your region is `us-east-1`, omit the bucket configuration.

   ```shell
   aws s3api create-bucket \
       --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> \
       --region us-east-1
   ```

2. Create an IAM user:

   ```shell
   aws iam create-user --user-name mke4backup
   ```

   {{< callout type="tip" >}}

   To deploy multiple MKE 4k clusters, you can create a unique
   username per cluster instead of the default `mke4backup`. For more
   information, refer to the official AWS documentation, [What is IAM?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html).

   {{< /callout >}}

3. Attach a policy to affix the necessary permissions to the IAM user.

   {{< callout type="info" >}}

   <details>

   <summary>Click for example policy</summary>

      ```shell
      cat > mke4backup-policy.json <<EOF
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                      "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                      "ec2:CreateTags",
                      "ec2:CreateVolume",
                      "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                      "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:GetObject",
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:PutObject",
                      "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                      "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}/*"
                  ]
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
      EOF
      ```

   </details>

   {{< /callout >}}

   ```shell
   aws iam put-user-policy \
     --user-name mke4backup \
     --policy-name mke4backup \
     --policy-document file://mke4backup-policy.json
   ```

4. Create an access key for the IAM user:

   ```shell
   aws iam create-access-key --user-name mke4backup
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   {
     "AccessKey": {
           "UserName": "mke4backup",
           "Status": "Active",
           "CreateDate": "2017-07-31T22:24:41.576Z",
           "SecretAccessKey": <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>,
           "AccessKeyId": <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      }
   }

5. Create an mke4backup-specific credentials file named `credentials-mke4backup`
   in your local directory, in which the access key ID and secret are the values returned from the `create-access-key` command:

   ```
   [mke4backup-profile]
   aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   ```

6. Edit the `storage_provider` section of the `mke4.yaml` configuration file,
   adding the AWS bucket name, bucket region, IAM credentials file path, and
   IAM credentials profile.

   Example:

   ```
   spec:
     backup:
       storage_provider:
         type: External
         external_options:
           provider: aws
           bucket: <BUCKET_NAME>
           region: <BUCKET_REGION>
           credentials_file_path: </PATH/TO/CREDENTIALS-MKE4BACKUP>
           credentials_file_profile: "mke4backup-profile"
   ```

7. Apply the configuration:

   ```shell
   mkectl apply
   ```

8. Verify the existence of the `BackupStorageLocation` custom resource:

   ```shell
   kubectl --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> get backupstoragelocation -n mke
   ```
   
   Example output:

   ```shell
   NAME      PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
   default   Available   20s              32s   true
   ```
   
   The output may require a few minutes to display.

## Create an external backup

To create a backup, run:

```shell
mkectl backup create --name aws-backup
```

Example output:

```shell
INFO[0000] Creating backup aws-backup...
Backup request "aws-backup" submitted successfully.
Run `velero backup describe aws-backup` or `velero backup logs aws-backup` for more details.
INFO[0000] Waiting for backup aws-backup to complete...
INFO[0003] Waiting for backup to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0006] Waiting for backup to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0009] Waiting for backup to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0012] Waiting for backup to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0015] Waiting for backup to complete. Current phase: Completed
INFO[0015] Backup aws-backup completed successfully
```

To list the backups, run:

```shell
mkectl backup list
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME         STATUS      ERRORS   WARNINGS   CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
aws-backup   Completed   0        0          2024-05-08 16:17:18 -0400 EDT   29d       default            <none>
```

##  Restore from an external backup

A restore operation returns the Kubernetes cluster to the state it was in at the time the backup you select was created.

To perform a restore using an external backup, run:

```shell
mkectl restore create --name aws-backup
```

Example output:

```shell
INFO[0000] Waiting for restore aws-backup-20240508161811 to complete...
INFO[0000] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0003] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0006] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0009] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0012] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0015] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0018] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0021] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: InProgress
INFO[0024] Waiting for restore to complete. Current phase: Completed
INFO[0024] Restore aws-backup-20240508161811 completed successfully
```

To list the restores, run:

```shell
mkectl restore list
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                        BACKUP       STATUS      STARTED                         COMPLETED                       ERRORS   WARNINGS   CREATED                         SELECTOR
aws-backup-20240508161811   aws-backup   Completed   2024-05-08 16:18:11 -0400 EDT   2024-05-08 16:18:34 -0400 EDT   0        108        2024-05-08 16:18:11 -0400 EDT   <none>
```

## Verify backups and restores

Using your AWS console, you can verify the presence of your backups and restores in the S3 bucket.
