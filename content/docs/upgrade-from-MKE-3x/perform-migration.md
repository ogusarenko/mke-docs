title: Perform the Upgrade
weight: 4
---

An upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4k consists of the following steps, all of which
are performed through the use of the `mkectl` tool:

- Run pre-upgrade checks to verify the upgradability of the cluster.
- Carry out pre-upgrade migrations to prepare the cluster for an upgrade from
  a hyperkube-based MKE 3 cluster to a k0s-based MKE 4k cluster.
- Upgrade manager nodes to k0s.
- Upgrade worker nodes to k0s.
- Carry out post-upgrade cleanup to remove MKE 3 components.
- Output the new `mke4.yaml` configuration file.

To upgrade an MKE 3 cluster, use the `mkectl upgrade` command:

```shell
mkectl upgrade --hosts-path <path-to-hosts-yaml> \
  --mke3-admin-username <admin-username> \
  --mke3-admin-password <admin-password> \
  --external-address <external-address>\
  --config-out <path-to-desired-file-location>
```

The `--config-out` flag allows you to specify a path where the MKE 4k configuration
file will be automatically created and saved during upgrade. If not specified,
the configuration file prints to your console on completion. In this case, save
the output to a file for future reference

### Offline upgrade

To perform an offline upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4k, [prepare your environment
as described in Offline
installation](../../getting-started/offline-installation/#preparation), and add
the following flags to the `mkectl upgrade` command:

* `--image-registry=<registry_full_path>`
* `--chart-registry=oci://<registry_full_path>`
* `--chart-registry-ca-file=<path/to/ca-cert.pem>`
* `--image-registry-ca-file=<path/to/ca-cert.pem>`
* `--mke3-airgapped=true`

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--image-registry`         | Sets your registry address with a project path that contains your MKE 4k images. For example, `private-registry.example.com:8080/mke`. <br><br>The setting must not end with a slash `/`.<br><br>The port is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `--chart-registry`         | Sets your registry address with a project path that contains your MKE 4k helm charts in OCI format. For example, `oci://private-registry.example.com:8080/mke`.<br><br>The setting must always start with `oci://`, and it must not end with a slash `/` .<br><br>If you uploaded the bundle as previously described, the registry address and path will be the same for chart and image registry, with the only difference being the `oci://` prefix in the chart registry URL. |
| `--chart-registry-ca-file` | 	Sets the path to the PEM encoded certificate of the Certificate Authority that issued chart registry TLS certificates. Optional. Must be provided if registry is using TLS certs issued by a non-publicly trusted CA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `--mke3-airgapped=true`    | Indicates that your environment is airgapped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Upgrade failure

In the event of an upgrade failure, the upgrade process rolls back,
restoring the MKE 3 cluster to its original state.

{{< /details >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}

A failed upgrade can leave behind an empty or corrupted `~/.mke/mke.kubeconf` file, which will block any subsequent upgrade attempts. To resolve this issue, manually delete the file:
```bash
rm -f ~/.mke/mke.kubeconf
```
Following this action, during the next upgrade, the system will automatically generate a valid configuration.
