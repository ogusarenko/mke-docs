| Authentication                    | MKE 4 uses Dex for authentication, which serves as a proxy between  MKE clusters and authentication providers. Dex supports the following authentication protocols: <br><br>* Basic authentication<br> *  OIDC<br> * SAML<br> * LDAP<br><br>SCIM, which is supported in MKE 3, is not supported in MKE 4.| [Configure OIDC service for MKE](../../configuration/authentication/oidc/#configure-oidc-service-for-mke), [Configure SAML service for MKE](../../configuration/authentication/saml#configure-saml-service-for-mke), [Configure LDAP service for MKE](../../configuration/authentication/ldap/#configure-ldap-service-for-mke) |
| Authorization                     | MKE 4 uses standard Kubernetes RBAC authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [RBAC Migrations](../../migrate-from-mke-3/#rbac-migrations)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
