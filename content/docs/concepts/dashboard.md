To access the MKE Dashboard, which is enabled by default, navigate to the address of the load balancer endpoint
from a freshly-installed cluster. Refer to [Load balancer requirements](../../getting-started/system-requirements#load-balancer-requirements) for detailed information.

You can disable the MKE Dashboard by setting the `enabled` field to `false` in the `dashboard`
section of the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
   dashboard:
     enabled: false
```
