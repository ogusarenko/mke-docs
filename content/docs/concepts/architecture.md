Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) 4 is an enterprise-grade, production-ready
Kubernetes platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and reliable.

You can manage the entire MKE cluster through the MKE configuration file.
Refer to [Configuration](../configuration) for details.

## Components

MKE 4 is built on top of k0s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution.
To learn more, refer to [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/v1.29.3+k0s.0/).

### Networking

By default, Calico is installed as the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin,
with the following configuration:

- IPv4 only, with a fixed Pod CIDR of `192.168.0.0/16`.
- The datastore mode set to `kdd`.
- `kube-proxy` set to `iptables` mode.
- A `vxlan` backend, which uses the default port of `4789` for traffic and default virtual network ID of `4096`.

Refer to [Container Network Interface](../cni) for the network configuration details
