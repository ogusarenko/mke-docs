You can configure LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for MKE 4k
through the `authentication.ldap` section of the `mke4.yaml` configuration
file.

LDAP example configuration:

```yaml
authentication:
  ldap:
    enabled: true
    host: ldap.example.org:389
    insecureNoSSL: true
    bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
    bindPW: password
    usernamePrompt: Email Address
    userSearch:
      baseDN: ou=People,dc=example,dc=org
      filter: "(objectClass=person)"
      username: mail
      idAttr: DN
      emailAttr: mail
      nameAttr: cn
```

## Configure LDAP service for MKE

In the `mke4.yaml` configuration file `authentication.ldap` section, enable your
LDAP service by setting `enabled` to `true`. Use the remaining fields, which
are defined in the following table, to configure
the interactions with your LDAP server.
