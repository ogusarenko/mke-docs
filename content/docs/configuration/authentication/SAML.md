You can configure SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for MKE 4 through
the `authentication.saml` section of the MKE configuration file.

SAML example configuration:

```yaml
authentication:
  saml:
    enabled: true
    ssoURL: https://dev64105006.okta.com/app/dev64105006_mke4saml_1/epkdtszgindywD6mF5s7/sso/saml
    usernameAttr: name
    emailAttr: email
```

## Configure SAML service for MKE

In the MKE configuration file `authentication.saml` section, enable your
SAML service by setting `enabled` to `true`. Use the remaining fields, which
are defined in the following table, to configure your chosen SAML provider.

{{< callout type="info" >}} For information on how to obtain the field values,
refer to [Setting up Okta as a SAML provider](../../../tutorials/authentication-provider-setup/setting-up-okta-as-a-saml-provider).
