title: Migrate from MKE 3.x
weight: 4
---

This section instructs you on how to migrate your existing MKE 3.7 cluster to the MKE 4.x version.

## Prerequisites

Verify that you have the following components in place before you begin upgrading MKE3 to MKE 4:

- A running MKE 3.7.x cluster:

  ```shell
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

  ```shell
  NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
  ip-172-31-103-202.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   7m3s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-104-233.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   7m3s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-191-216.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   6m59s   v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-199-207.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   8m4s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ```

- The latest `mkectl` binary, installed on your local environment:

  ```shell
  mkectl version
  ```

  Example output:

  ```shell
  Version: v4.0.0-alpha.1.0
  ```

- `k0sctl` version `0.19.0`, installed on your local environment:

  ```shell
  k0sctl version
  ```

  Example output:

  ```shell
  version: v0.19.0
  commit: 9246ddc
  ```

- A `hosts.yaml` file, to provide the information required by `mkectl` to
  connect to each node with SSH.

  Example `hosts.yaml` file:

  ```shell
  cat hosts.yaml
  ```

  ```shell
  hosts:
    - address: <host1-external-ip>
      port: <ssh-port>
      user: <ssh-user>
      keyPath: <path-to-ssh-key>
    - address: <host2-external-ip>
      port: <ssh-port>
      user: <ssh-user>
      keyPath: <path-to-ssh-key>
  ```

## Migrate configuration

In migrating to MKE 4 from MKE 3, you can directly transfer settings using `mkectl`.

**To convert a local MKE 3 configuration for MKE 4:** set the `--mke3-config` flag
to convert a downloaded MKE 3 configuration file into a valid MKE 4 configuration
file:

```bash
mkectl init --mke3-config </path/to/mke3-config.toml>
```

{{< callout type="info" >}} To upgrade an MKE 3 cluster with GPU enabled,
ensure you complete the [GPU prerequisites](/docs/configuration/gpu/#prerequisites) before
starting the upgrade process. {{< /callout >}}

## Perform the migration

An upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4 consists of the following steps, all of which
are performed through the use of the `mkectl` tool:

- Run pre-upgrade checks to verify the upgradability of the cluster.
- Carry out pre-upgrade migrations to prepare the cluster for a migration from
  a hyperkube-based MKE 3 cluster to a k0s-based MKE 4 cluster.
- Migrate manager nodes to k0s.
- Migrate worker nodes to k0s.
- Carry out post-upgrade cleanup to remove MKE 3 components.
- Output the new MKE 4 config file.

To upgrade an MKE 3 cluster, use the `mkectl upgrade` command:

```shell
mkectl upgrade --hosts-path <path-to-hosts-yaml> \
  --mke3-admin-username <admin-username> \
  --mke3-admin-password <admin-password> \
  --external-address <external-address>\
  --config-out <path-to-desired-file-location>
```

The external address is the domain name of the load balancer. For details,
see [System requirements: Load balancer requirements](../getting-started/system-requirements#load-balancer-requirements).

The `--config-out` flag allows you to specify a path where the MKE 4 configuration
file will be automatically created and saved during migration. If not specified,
the configuration file prints to your console on completion. In this case, save
the output to a file for future reference

The upgrade process requires time to complete. Once the process is complete,
run the following command to verify that the MKE 4 cluster is operating:

```shell
sudo k0s kc get nodes
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-172-31-103-202.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   29m   v1.29.3+k0s
ip-172-31-104-233.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   29m   v1.29.3+k0s
ip-172-31-191-216.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   29m   v1.29.3+k0s
ip-172-31-199-207.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   30m   v1.29.3+k0s
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}

The MKE 3 cluster will no longer be accessible through the previously created
client bundle. The docker swarm cluster will no longer be accessible as well.

{{< /callout >}}

In the event of an upgrade failure, the upgrade process rolls back,
restoring the MKE 3 cluster to its original state.

## RBAC Migrations

As MKE 4 does not support Swarm mode, the platform uses standard [Kubernetes
RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
As such, the Swarm authorization configuration that is in place for MKE 3 is not present in MKE 4.


### Groups

To enable the same RBAC hierarchy as in MKE 3 with ``orgs`` and ``teams`` groups, but
without the two-level limitation, MKE 4 replaces ``orgs`` and ``teams`` with
the Kubernetes ``AggregatedRoles``. 

**Authorization structure comparison:**

```
MKE 3:                           MKE 4:

├── entire-company (org)         ├── entire-company-org (AggregatedRole)
│   ├── development (team)       ├── development-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)           │   ├── bob (user)
│   ├── production (team)        ├── production-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)│          │   ├── bob (user)
│   │   ├── bill (user)          │   ├── bill (user)
│   ├── sales (team)             ├── sales-team (AggregatedRole)
```

### Roles

Roles are bound to the aggregated roles for integration into the org, team, and user structure.
Thus, what was previously an organization or a team role will have ``-org`` or ``-team``
appended to its name.

A role can be assigned at any level in the hierarchy, with its permissions granted to all members
at that same level.

**Example organization binding:**

```
├── entire-company-org (AggregatedRole) -- entire-company-org (RoleBinding) -- view (Role)
│   ├── development-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
│   ├── production-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
│   │   ├── bill (user)
│   ├── sales-team (AggregatedRole)
```


In the example above, all members of the ``entire-company`` org group have
``view`` permissions. This includes the ``development-team``,
``production-team``, ``sales-team``, ``bob``, and ``bill``.

**Example team binding:**

```
│   ├── development:team (AggregatedRole) -- development:team (RoleBinding) -- edit (Role)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
```

In the example above, the binding grants ``edit`` permissions only to the
members of the development team, which only includes ``bob``.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}

Swarm roles are partially translated to Kubernetes roles. During migration,
any detected Swarm role is replicated without permissions, thus
preserving the org/team/user structure.
If no Swarm roles are detected, a ``none`` role is created as a placeholder,
as Kubernetes requires each aggregated role to have at least one role.
This ``none`` role has no permissions, with its only purpose being to maintain
structural integrity.

## CoreDNS Lameduck migration

MKE 4 supports migration from MKE 3 systems that are running with CoreDNS and
Lameduck enabled. Refer
to the table below for a comparison of the CoreDNS Lameduck configuration
parameters between MKE 3 and MKE 4:

| MKE 3                                              | MKE 4                 |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| [cluster_config.core_dns_lameduck_config.enabled]  | dns.lameduck.enabled  |
| [cluster_config.core_dns_lameduck_config.duration] | dns.lameduck.duration |
