title: Migrate from MKE 3.x
weight: 4
---

Comprehensive information is offered herein on how to migrate your existing MKE
3.7 or 3.8 cluster to MKE 4k.

{{< callout type="important" >}}

In the event of migration failure, the cluster will rollback to your previous
MKE 3 configuration. Should this occur, Mirantis recommends that you retain the
upgrade logs from the terminal.

{{< /callout >}}

Following a successful migration:
- Any swarm workloads will no longer exist.
- It is necessary to download new kubeconfig files from k0s.
- The UCP Controller API will no longer be active or supported, and thus the
  MKE 3 client bundle will become invalid.
- The terminal prints a summary of the process.

  {{< details title="Example: Migration Summary" closed="true" >}}

  ```

  ```

  {{< /details >}}

Be aware that any workloads running in your MKE 3 system will not be available
during the migration process.

The upgrade period depends on the size of your cluster. You can track the
progress of your migration by way of the terminal, which displays step-by-step
logs on the current state of migration.

## Prerequisites

Verify that you have the following components in place before you begin upgrading MKE 3 to MKE 4:

- An MKE cluster running the latest 3.7.x or 3.8.x release:

  ```shell
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

  ```shell
  NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
  ip-172-31-103-202.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   7m3s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-104-233.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   7m3s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-191-216.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   6m59s   v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ip-172-31-199-207.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   8m4s    v1.27.7-mirantis-1
  ```

- A backup of the MKE cluster. For comprehensive instruction on how to create
  an MKE 3 back up, refer to [Back up MKE](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/current/ops/disaster-recovery/back-up-mke.html).

- The latest `mkectl` binary, installed on your local environment:

  ```shell
  mkectl version
  ```

  Example output:

  ```shell
  Version: v4.0.0
  ```

- `k0sctl` version `0.19.0`, installed on your local environment:

  ```shell
  k0sctl version
  ```

  Example output:

  ```shell
  version: v0.19.4
  commit: a06d3f6
  ```

- A `hosts.yaml` file, to provide the information required by `mkectl` to
  connect to each node with SSH.

  Example `hosts.yaml` file:

  ```shell
  cat hosts.yaml
  ```

  ```shell
  hosts:
    - address: <host1-external-ip>
      port: <ssh-port>
      user: <ssh-user>
      keyPath: <path-to-ssh-key>
    - address: <host2-external-ip>
      port: <ssh-port>
      user: <ssh-user>
      keyPath: <path-to-ssh-key>
  ```

- A ``calico_kdd`` flag is set to ``true`` in the MKE 3 configuration
  file and applied to the MKE 3 cluster:

  ```yaml
  calico_kdd = true
  ```

- Calico KDD (Kubernetes Datastore Driver), enabled:

  1. Verify that the MKE 3.x instance being upgraded to MKE 4 is running the
     latest 3.7.x or 3.8.x release.

  2. Obtain the MKE 3 configuration file:
 
     ```shell
     $ export MKE_USERNAME=<mke-username>
     $ export MKE_PASSWORD=<mke-password>
     $ export MKE_HOST=<mke-fqdm-or-ip-address>
     $ curl --silent --insecure -X GET "https://$MKE_HOST/api/ucp/config-toml" -H "accept: application/toml" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHTOKEN" > mke-config.toml
     ```

  3. In the `cluster_config` section of the MKE 3 configuration file, set the
     `calico_kdd` parameter to `true`.

  4. Apply the modified MKE 3 configuration file:

     ```shell
     $ AUTHTOKEN=$(curl --silent --insecure --data '{"username":"'$MKE_USERNAME'","password":"'$MKE_PASSWORD'"}' https://$MKE_HOST/auth/login | jq --raw-output .auth_token)
     $ curl --silent --insecure -X PUT -H "accept: application/toml" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHTOKEN" --upload-file 'mke-config.toml' https://$MKE_HOST/api/ucp/config-toml
     {"message":"Calico datastore migration from etcd to kdd successful"}
     ```

{{< callout type="info" >}} The conversion of the Calico datastore from etcd to
KDD typically takes about 20 seconds per node, depending on the size of the cluster. On
completion, the following confirmation displays:

```shell
{"message":"Calico datastore migration from etcd to kdd successful"}
```
{{< /callout >}}

## Perform the migration

An upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4 consists of the following steps, all of which
are performed through the use of the `mkectl` tool:

- Run pre-upgrade checks to verify the upgradability of the cluster.
- Carry out pre-upgrade migrations to prepare the cluster for a migration from
  a hyperkube-based MKE 3 cluster to a k0s-based MKE 4 cluster.
- Migrate manager nodes to k0s.
- Migrate worker nodes to k0s.
- Carry out post-upgrade cleanup to remove MKE 3 components.
- Output the new MKE 4 config file.

To upgrade an MKE 3 cluster, use the `mkectl upgrade` command:

```shell
mkectl upgrade --hosts-path <path-to-hosts-yaml> \
  --mke3-admin-username <admin-username> \
  --mke3-admin-password <admin-password> \
  --external-address <external-address>\
  --config-out <path-to-desired-file-location>
```

The external address is the domain name of the load balancer. For details,
see [System requirements: Load balancer
requirements](../getting-started/system-requirements#load-balancer-requirements).

The `--config-out` flag allows you to specify a path where the MKE 4 configuration
file will be automatically created and saved during migration. If not specified,
the configuration file prints to your console on completion. In this case, save
the output to a file for future reference

The upgrade process requires time to complete. Once the process is complete,
run the following command to verify that the MKE 4 cluster is operating:

```shell
sudo k0s kc get nodes
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
ip-172-31-111-4.us-west-1.compute.internal     Ready    control-plane   45h   v1.31.2+k0s
ip-172-31-216-253.us-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>          45h   v1.31.2+k0s
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}

The MKE 3 cluster will no longer be accessible through the previously created
client bundle. The docker swarm cluster will no longer be accessible as well.

{{< /callout >}}

### Offline upgrade

To perform an offline upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4k, [prepare your environment
as described in Offline
installation](../getting-started/offline-installation/#preparation), and add
the following flags to the `mkectl upgrade` command:

* `--image-registry=<registry_full_path>`
* `--chart-registry=oci://<registry_full_path>`
* `--mke3-airgapped=true`

| Setting                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--image-registry` | Sets your registry address with a project path that contains your MKE 4 images. For example, `private-registry.example.com:8080/mke`. <br><br>The setting must not end with a slash `/`.<br><br>The port is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--chart-registry` | Sets your registry address with a project path that contains your MKE 4 helm charts in OCI format. For example, `oci://private-registry.example.com:8080/mke`.<br><br>The setting must always start with `oci://`, and it must not end with a slash `/` .<br><br>If you uploaded the bundle as previously described, the registry address and path will be the same for chart and image registry, with the only difference being the `oci://` prefix in the chart registry URL. |
| `--mke3-airgapped=true`        | Indicates that your environment is airgapped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Migration failure

In the event of an upgrade failure, the upgrade process rolls back,
restoring the MKE 3 cluster to its original state.

## Revert the migration

To revert a cluster upgraded to MKE 4 back to MKE 3:

1. [Uninstall MKE 4](../getting-started/uninstall-cluster).

2. [Restore MKE 3 from a backup](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/current/ops/disaster-recovery.html).


## RBAC Migrations

As MKE 4 does not support Swarm mode, the platform uses standard [Kubernetes
RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
As such, the Swarm authorization configuration that is in place for MKE 3 is not present in MKE 4.

### Groups

To enable the same RBAC hierarchy as in MKE 3 with `orgs` and `teams` groups, but
without the two-level limitation, MKE 4 replaces `orgs` and `teams` with
the Kubernetes `AggregatedRoles`.

**Authorization structure comparison:**

```
MKE 3:                           MKE 4:

├── entire-company (org)         ├── entire-company-org (AggregatedRole)
│   ├── development (team)       ├── development-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)           │   ├── bob (user)
│   ├── production (team)        ├── production-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)│          │   ├── bob (user)
│   │   ├── bill (user)          │   ├── bill (user)
│   ├── sales (team)             ├── sales-team (AggregatedRole)
```

### Roles

Roles are bound to the aggregated roles for integration into the org, team, and user structure.
Thus, what was previously an organization or a team role will have `-org` or `-team`
appended to its name.

A role can be assigned at any level in the hierarchy, with its permissions granted to all members
at that same level.

**Example organization binding:**

```
├── entire-company-org (AggregatedRole) -- entire-company-org (RoleBinding) -- view (Role)
│   ├── development-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
│   ├── production-team (AggregatedRole)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
│   │   ├── bill (user)
│   ├── sales-team (AggregatedRole)
```

In the example above, all members of the `entire-company` org group have
`view` permissions. This includes the `development-team`,
`production-team`, `sales-team`, `bob`, and `bill`.

**Example team binding:**

```
│   ├── development:team (AggregatedRole) -- development:team (RoleBinding) -- edit (Role)
│   │   ├── bob (user)
```

In the example above, the binding grants `edit` permissions only to the
members of the development team, which only includes `bob`.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}

Swarm roles are partially translated to Kubernetes roles. During migration,
any detected Swarm role is replicated without permissions, thus
preserving the org/team/user structure.
If no Swarm roles are detected, a `none` role is created as a placeholder,
as Kubernetes requires each aggregated role to have at least one role.
This `none` role has no permissions, with its only purpose being to maintain
structural integrity.

## CoreDNS Lameduck migration

MKE 4 supports migration from MKE 3 systems that are running with CoreDNS and
Lameduck enabled. Refer
to the table below for a comparison of the CoreDNS Lameduck configuration
parameters between MKE 3 and MKE 4:

| MKE 3                                              | MKE 4                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [cluster_config.core_dns_lameduck_config.enabled]  | dns.lameduck.enabled  |
| [cluster_config.core_dns_lameduck_config.duration] | dns.lameduck.duration |

## Troubleshoot migration

You can address various potential MKE migration issues using the tips and
suggestions detailed herein.

### MKE 3 ``etcdv3`` backend is unsupported for MKE 4 upgrade

During the upgrade from MKE 3 to MKE 4, which defaults to the ``etcdv3``
backend, you may receive the following error:

```bash
mkectl upgrade --hosts-path hosts.yaml --mke3-admin-username admin --mke3-admin-password <mke_admin_password> -l debug --config-out new-mke4.yaml --external-address <mke4_external_address>
...
Error: unable to generate upgrade config: unsupported configuration for mke4 upgrade: mke3 cluster is using etcdv3 and not kdd backend for calico
```

To resolve the issue, ensure that:

- The MKE 3 source is the latest 3.7.x or 3.8.x release.
- The ``calico_kdd`` flag in the MKE 3 configuration file is set to `true`.
- The configuration is applied to the MKE 3 cluster.

{{< callout type="info" >}}

A KDD mode migration is irreversible. Thus, to reduce risk, when migrating
enterprise clusters, it is recommended that you work directly with Mirantis to
plan the process and monitor it through to completion.

{{< /callout >}}

Example output:

```bash
$ AUTHTOKEN=$(curl --silent --insecure --data '{"username":"'$MKE_USERNAME'","password":"'$MKE_PASSWORD'"}' https://$MKE_HOST/auth/login | jq --raw-output .auth_token)

$ curl --silent --insecure -X PUT -H "accept: application/toml" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHTOKEN" --upload-file 'mke-config.toml' https://$MKE_HOST/api/ucp/config-toml
{"message":"Calico datastore migration from etcd to kdd successful"}
```

{{< callout type="important" >}}

To migrate an etcd-backed cluster to KDD, contact Mirantis support.
