your MKE installation. The CLI provides a convenient and powerful way to
interact with your cluster, perform administrative tasks, and automate
workflows.

The [creation of an MKE 4 cluster](create-cluster) involves configuring the cluster settings,
specifying the number of nodes, and setting up networking and storage options.
Use the MKE CLI to initialize and configure the cluster according to your
requirements.

### Interact with the cluster

Once created, you can interact with your MKE 4 cluster, using it to deploy
