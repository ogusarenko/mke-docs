### Meet the system requirements

Ensure that your system meets the necessary hardware and software
requirements for installing and running an MKE 4k cluster. For full
details, refer to the  [System requirements](system-requirements).

### Install the MKE 4k CLI and other dependencies

[Install the MKE 4k Command Line Interface (CLI)](install-MKE-4k-CLI), which is
essential for managing your MKE 4k installation. The CLI provides a convenient
and powerful way to interact with your cluster, perform administrative tasks,
and automate workflows.

### License MKE 4k

You must have a valid license to lawfully run MKE 4k. Refer to [Licensing MKE
4k](licensing-mke4k) for information on how to obtain and add a license to your
MKE 4k installation.

### Create a cluster

The [creation of an MKE 4k cluster](create-cluster) involves configuring the
cluster settings, specifying the number of nodes, and setting up networking and
storage options. Use the MKE 4k CLI to initialize and configure the cluster
according to your requirements.

### Interact with the cluster

Once created, you can interact with your MKE 4k cluster, using it to deploy
applications and services, and thus leverage its full capabilities for
container orchestration and management.
