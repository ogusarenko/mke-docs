### Meet the system requirements

Ensure that your system meets the necessary hardware and software
requirements for installing and running an MKE cluster. For full
details, refer to the  [System requirements](system-requirements).

### Install the MKE CLI and other dependencies

[Install the MKE Command Line Interface (CLI)](install-mke-cli), which is
essential for managing your MKE installation. The CLI provides a convenient and
powerful way to interact with your cluster, perform administrative tasks, and
automate workflows.

### License MKE 4

You must have a valid license to lawfully run MKE 4. Refer to [Licensing MKE
4](licensing-mke4) for information on how to obtain and add a license to your
MKE 4 installation.

### Create a cluster

The [creation of an MKE 4 cluster](create-cluster) involves configuring the
cluster settings, specifying the number of nodes, and setting up networking and
storage options. Use the MKE CLI to initialize and configure the cluster
according to your requirements.

### Interact with the cluster

Once created, you can interact with your MKE 4 cluster, using it to deploy
applications and services, and thus leverage its full capabilities for
container orchestration and management.
