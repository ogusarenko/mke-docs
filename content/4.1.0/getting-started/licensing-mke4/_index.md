{{< callout type="warning" >}}

You must have a valid license to lawfully run MKE 4k. For more
information, refer to [Mirantis Agreements and Terms](https://legal.mirantis.com/).

{{< /callout >}}

To license MKE 4k:

1. [Obtain your MKE 4k license.](obtain-mke4k-license)

2. [Set the license in your configuration.](set-license-in-configuration)

{{< callout type="info" >}} Mirantis recommends that you set the license in the
MKE 4k configuration file prior to the creation of your MKE 4k cluster. You can, however, [apply the
license following cluster creation using the MKE 4k web
UI](apply-mke4k-license-post-installation).
