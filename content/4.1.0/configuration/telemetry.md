You can set MKE 4k to automatically record and transmit data to Mirantis through
an encrypted channel for monitoring and analysis purposes. This data helps the
Mirantis Customer Success Organization to better understand how customers
use MKE. It also provides product usage statistics, which is key feedback that
helps product teams in their efforts to enhance Mirantis products and
services.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
   The MKE 4k telemetry enablement setting is automatically applied to the k0s
   configuration. 
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
   Telemetry is automatically enabled for MKE 4k clusters that are running
   without a license, with a license that has expired, or with an invalid
   license. In all of such scenarios, you can only disable
   telemetry once a valid license has been applied to the cluster.

## Enable telemetry through the MKE 4k CLI

1. Access the `mke4.yaml` configuration file.
2. Set the `spec.tracking.enabled` field to `true`.

   ```yaml
   spec:
     tracking:
       enabled: true
       clusterLabel: <optional-label-to-include-with-analytics>
   ```

3. Run the  `mkectl apply` command to apply the new settings.

After a few moments, the change will reconcile in the configuration. From this point onward,
MKE 4k will transmit key usage data to Mirantis by way of a secure Segment endpoint.
