Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) 4k supports running workloads on NVIDIA GPU
nodes. Current support is limited to NVIDIA GPUs.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
GPU Feature Discovery (GFD) is enabled by default.
{{< /callout >}}

To manage your GPU resources and enable GPU support, MKE 4k installs the NVIDIA
GPU Operator on your cluster. The use of this resource causes the following
resources to be installed and configured on each node:

* [GPU device driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Though it is not required, you can run the following command at any point to verify your GPU specifications:

```
sudo lspci | grep -i nvidia
```

Example output:

```
00:1e.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation TU104GL [Tesla T4] (rev a1)
```

{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="important" >}}

For air-gapped MKE 4k clusters, you must deploy a package registry and mirror the drivers to it, as described in the
official NVIDIA documentation, [Install NVIDIA GPU Operator in Air-Gapped

{{< /callout >}}

## Configuration

NVIDIA GPU support is disabled in MKE 4k by default.

**To enable NVIDIA GPU support:**

1. Obtain the `mke4.yaml` configuration file:

   ```
   mkectl init > mke4.yaml
   ```

2. Navigate to the `devicePlugins.nvidiaGPU` section of the mke4.yaml
   configuration file, and set the `enabled` parameter to `true`.

   ```yaml
   devicePlugins:
     nvidiaGPU:
       enabled: true
   ```

3. Apply the new configuration setting:

   ```
   mkectl apply -f mke4.yaml
   ```

{{< callout type="important" >}}
Pod startup time can vary depending on node performance, during which the Pods
will seem to be in a state of failure.

## Verification

Once your NVIDIA GPU support configuration has completed, you can verify your
setup using the tests detailed below:

### Detect NVIDIA GPU Devices

1. Run a simple GPU workload that reports detected NVIDIA GPU devices:

   ```yaml
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: gpu-pod
   spec:
     restartPolicy: Never
     containers:
       - name: cuda-container
         image: nvcr.io/nvidia/cloud-native/gpu-operator-validator:v22.9.0
         resources:
           limits:
             nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # requesting 1 GPU
     tolerations:
     - key: nvidia.com/gpu
       operator: Exists
       effect: NoSchedule
   EOF
   ```

2. Verify the successful completion of the Pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods | grep "gpu-pod"
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash
   NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   gpu-pod                     0/1     Completed 0          7m56s
   ```

### Run a GPU Workload

1. Create the workload:

   ```
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: cuda-vectoradd
   spec:
     restartPolicy: OnFailure
     containers:
     - name: cuda-vectoradd
       image: "nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:vectoradd-cuda11.7.1-ubuntu20.04"
       resources:
         limits:
           nvidia.com/gpu: 1
   EOF
    ```

2. Run the following command once the Pod has reached `Completed` status:

   ```
   kubectl logs pod/cuda-vectoradd
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   [Vector addition of 50000 elements]
   Copy input data from the host memory to the CUDA device
   CUDA kernel launch with 196 blocks of 256 threads
   Copy output data from the CUDA device to the host memory
   Test PASSED
   Done
   ```

3. Clean up the Pod:

   ```
   kubectl delete -f cuda-vectoradd.yaml
   ```

### Count GPUs

Run the following command once you have enabled the NVIDIA GPU Device Plugin
and the Pods have stabilized:

```
kubectl get nodes "-o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPUs:.metadata.labels.nvidia\.com/gpu\.count"
```

Example results, showing a cluster with 3 control-plane nodes and 3 worker nodes:

```
NAME                                           GPUs
ip-172-31-174-195.us-east-2.compute.internal   1
ip-172-31-228-160.us-east-2.compute.internal   <none>
ip-172-31-231-180.us-east-2.compute.internal   1
ip-172-31-26-15.us-east-2.compute.internal     <none>
ip-172-31-3-198.us-east-2.compute.internal     1
ip-172-31-99-105.us-east-2.compute.internal    <none>
```
