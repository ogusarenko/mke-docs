title: Upgrade from MKE 3.7 or 3.8
weight: 4
---

{{< callout type="warning" >}}

Only MKE 3.7.15+ and MKE 3.8.x versions can be upgraded to MKE 4k. Mirantis
recommends that before you perform the upgrade, you first upgrade to the latest
3.7.15+ or 3.8.x release.

{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="important" >}}

In the event of upgrade failure, the cluster will rollback to your previous
MKE 3 configuration. Should this occur, Mirantis recommends that you retain the
upgrade logs from the terminal.

{{< /callout >}}

Comprehensive information is offered herein on how to upgrade your existing MKE
3.7 or 3.8 cluster to MKE 4k.

Following a successful upgrade:
- Any swarm workloads will no longer exist.
- For the admin user, the kubeconfig file is present in the `~/.mke/` directory of the machine upon which the ``mkectl`` command was executed. For other users, the admin can [create their kubeconfig files](../getting-started/access-manage-cluster-kubectl/).
- The UCP Controller API will no longer be active or supported, and thus the
  MKE 3 client bundle will become invalid for MKE 4k.
- The terminal prints a summary of the process.

The upgrade period depends on the size of your cluster. You can track the
progress of your upgrade by way of the terminal, which displays step-by-step
logs on the current state of upgrade.
