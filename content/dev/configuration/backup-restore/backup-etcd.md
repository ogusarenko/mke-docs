MKE 4k uses etcd as its backing datastore. It supports etcd back up using
``mkectl etcd`` subcommands.

Backups of etcd are saved as local tarballs.

Backups of etcd are not currently integrated with the
other MKE 4k backup storage solutions.

## Create an etcd backup

To create an etcd backup and save it to a local path, run:

```
mkectl etcd backup -f <config_file_path>
```

You can provide a name for the backup using the ``--name flag``. Otherwise, an
autogenerated name will be applied.

## Restore an etcd backup

To restore an etcd backup, run:

```
mkectl etcd restore --name <backup_name> -f <config_file_path>
```

This will restore the etcd backup to the target cluster. Be aware that this
operation will result in cluster disruption, as the cluster will be restored to
the state it was in at the point the backup was created.
