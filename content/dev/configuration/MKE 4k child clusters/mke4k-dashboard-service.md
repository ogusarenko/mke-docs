The MKE 4k Dashboard is a default service that is always installed and enabled.
On child clusters it works in read-only mode since all configuration management
is handled from the mothership cluster.

To obtain the address of the MKE dashboard on the child cluster, refer to [kube-apiserver options](../kube-api-server-options).

Refer to [MKE 4k Dashboard](../../../configuration/mke4k-dashboard/) for more details.
