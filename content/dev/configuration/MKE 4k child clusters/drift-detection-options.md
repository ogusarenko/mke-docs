Common configuration file section: `.spec.driftDetection`

By default, the `driftDetection.disabled` flag is set to `false`, and thus
drift detection is enabled. To fully disable drift detection for child
clusters, set the flag to `true`.

Refer to [Configuration Drift Detection](../../../configuration/configuration-drift-detection) for more details.
