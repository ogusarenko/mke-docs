The `MkeChildConfig` configuration file does not contain a cloud provider
configuration as the cloud provider is always enabled and installed by default
on child clusters as a k0s extension. This is required to make the cluster
operational.

Refer to [Cloud providers](../../../configuration/cloudproviders/) for more details.
