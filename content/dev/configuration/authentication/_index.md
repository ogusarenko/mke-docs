MKE 4k uses [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) for authentication. Dex serves as a proxy
between your MKE 4k cluster and your authentication providers, combining the
configuration of multiple authentication providers into a single configuration
while also handling the complexity of the various protocols.

Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) 4k supports the following authentication
protocols:

- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

## Prerequisites

You must have certain dependencies in place before you can configure
authentication. These dependencies differ, depending on which authentication
protocol you choose to deploy.

- **Identity Provider (IdP):** To use OIDC or SAML, you must configure an identity provider. For examples of how to use Okta as an authentication service provider for either of these protocols, refer to [OIDC](../../configuration/authentication/oidc) or [SAML](../../configuration/authentication/saml).

- **LDAP Server:** To use LDAP, you must have an LDAP server configured. A setup example for an OpenLDAP server is available at [LDAP](../../configuration/authentication/ldap).

## Configuration

You configure authentication for MKE 4k through the `authentication` section
of the `mke4.yaml` configuration file.

Authentication is always enabled, however, the settings for each of the
individual authentication protocols are disabled. To enable and install an
authentication protocol, set its `enabled` configuration option to `true`.

```yaml
authentication:
  expiry: {}
  ldap:
    enabled: false
  oidc:
    enabled: false
  replicaCount: 1
  saml:
    enabled: false
```

## Set Expiration

You can use the `expiry` section of the configuration file to set the expiration time for refresh and id tokens, in the format of number + time unit format. For example, `1h` to designate one hour.

```yaml
authentication:
  expiry:
    refreshTokens: {}
```

The following table shows all of the available fields for the `expiry` section.

| Field                                    | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `expiry`                                 | Section for the various expiry settings.                                 |
| `expiry.idTokens`                        | Lifetime of the ID tokens.                                               |
| `expiry.authRequests`                    | Time frame that a code can be exchanged for a token.                     |
| `expiry.deviceRequests`                  | Time frame in which users can authorize a device to receive a token.     |
| `expiry.signingKeys`                     | Time period after which the signing keys are rotated.                    |
| `expiry.refreshTokens`                   | Section for the various refresh token settings.                          |
| `expiry.refreshTokens.validIfNotUsedFor` | Invalidate a refresh token if it is not used for the specified time.     |
| `expiry.refreshTokens.absoluteLifetime`  | Absolute time frame of a refresh token.                                  |
| `expiry.refreshTokens.disableRotation`   | Disable every-request rotation.                                          |
| `expiry.refreshTokens.reuseInterval`     | Interval for obtaining the same refresh token from the refresh endpoint. |


## Configure OAuth2

You can use the ``mke4k.yaml`` configuration file to configure the Dex
``oauth2`` fields.

Example configuration:

```yaml
authentication:
    oauth2:
      responseTypes: [ "code" ]
      skipApprovalScreen: true
      alwaysShowLoginScreen: false
```

| Field 	| Description 	|
|---	|---	|
| ``responseTypes`` 	| Use to configure the desired auth flow based on different values: <br><br> ``code`` --> Authorization Code Flow<br> ``id_token`` --> Implicit Flow<br> ``id_token token`` --> Implicit Flow<br> ``code id_token`` --> Hybrid Flow<br> ``code token`` --> Hybrid Flow<br> ``code id_token token`` --> Hybrid Flow 	|
| ``skipApprovalScreen`` 	| Set to ``true`` to require users to approve sharing data with the connected application on every login. 	|
| ``alwaysShowLoginScreen`` 	| Set to ``true`` to always show the login page, even when only one authentication type is configured. 	|

## Add Third-Party Client Applications

You can use third-party client applications with MKE 4k, each with the ability
to use the same authentication options that are available in the MKE 4k
cluster. To do this, obtain the current `mke4.yaml` configuration file, add a
list of the client applications to the file, and reapply the file to the MKE 4k
cluster.

Example configuration:

```yaml
authentication:
    clients:
    - id: example
      name:"Example Client"
      redirectURIs:
      - localhost:8080
      secret: ZXhhbXBsZS1hcHAtc2VjcmV0
```

| Field                                    | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `clients`                                 | Section for the various client settings, within which each client is represented as a list.                                 |
| `clients.id`                                 | Unique ID for the client, which must match the ID passed by the client during authentication.                                 |
| `clients.name`                                 | Human-readable name for the client.                                 |
| `clients.redirectURIs`                                 | A list of URIs for the client from which an authentication will accept auth requests and to which an authentication will return successful auths to.                                 |
| `clients.secret`                                 | A `secret` that is passed by the client to validate that it is allowed to use authentication. Its intended use is with backend client applications that can keep the secret hidden.                                 |
| `clients.public`                                 | Eliminates the need for a secret that must be shared with each client setup.                                 |

## Add Audiences

Audiences determine which parties are permitted to make requests to the
cluster API. Adding the client as an audience allows it to leverage the Kubernetes API to display and edit cluster information.

```yaml
authentication:
    audience:
    - kubelogin
```
| Field                                    | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `audience`                                 | A list of audience names.                                 |
