It is important to be familiar with the MKE 4k limitations related to Container
Network Interfaces before deploying a CNI plugin.

- MKE 4k does not support Calico Enterprise.
- MKE 4k does not support IPVS.
- Only clusters that use the default Kubernetes proxier `iptables` can be
  upgraded from MKE 3 to MKE 4k.
- Only KDD-backed MKE 3 clusters can be upgraded to MKE 4k. Refer to [Upgrade
  from MKE 3.7 or 3.8](../../../upgrade-from-mke-3x) for more information.
